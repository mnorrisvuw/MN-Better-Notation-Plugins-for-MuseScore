### <img width="200px" src="MNCheckLayoutAndInstrumentation.png" alt="Check Layout and Instrumentation" style="vertical-align:top; margin-right:10px"> MN CHECK LAYOUT AND INSTRUMENTATION

* **MN Check Layout & Instrumentation** checks for over 70 different layout, notation and instrumentation problems, such as:
  * **Spacing and layout**: inappropriate staff size, inappropriate margins, barline width too thick, bar spacing too wide or too narrow, minimum bar width too small, inappropriate spacing ratio, note spacing too wide or narrow, some style settings not optimal, bar number on first bar, staff spacing not optimal, system spacing not optimal, page size not A3 or A4, last system not finishing in bottom right-hand corner of page, barlines not going through all staves of standard small ensemble, stretch factors applied inappropriately, no title page for work longer than 2 pages, name of work missing from first page of music, subtitle missing for solo works
  * **Staff names and order**: non-standard staff names, missing staff names, non-standard staff name visibility, incorrect staff order, duplicate staff names  * **Fonts and styles**: non-optimal tuplets font, incorrectly styled text, incorrect dynamics font, non-optimal page number font, tempo size too small
  * **Dynamics**: missing first dynamic, redundant dynamics, long hairpins not â€˜terminatedâ€™, incorrect location for dynamics, dynamic needing restating after long rest, â€˜dim.â€™/â€˜cresc.â€™ used instead of hairpins
  * **Tempo markings**: tempo marking not entered in Tempo text, rit./accel. without a terminating metronome mark/tempo indication/a tempo/tempo primo, tempo marking too large, metronome marking in bold, tempo marking not in bold
  * **Text objects**: common misspellings, incorrectly capitalised text, space or non-alphanumeric character at start, text could be abbreviated, incorrect location for expressions, straight quotes instead of curly, default title/subtitle/composer not changed
  * **Vocal music**: notes lacking lyrics, notes lacking melismatic extensions, melismata lacking slurs, multiple syllables under one slur, correct positioning of dynamics
  * **Orchestral parts issues**: monophonic line on a shared wind/brass staff missing player indication (e.g. 1./a 2 etc.); monophonic orchestral string part lacking â€˜unis.â€™ after â€˜div.â€™ marking
  * **String-specific issues**: redundant arco/pizz./col legno/tasto/pont/ord. markings, passage that looks arco but is marked pizz., incorrect notation for string harmonics, string harmonic does not exist, artificial harmonic interval incorrect, overly long slurs, long pizz. notes, staccato pizz. notes, slurs that may be too long for one bow stroke, fingered tremolos not slurred, bowed tremolos slurred, multiple-stops where two notes have to be played on the same string, triple- or quadruple-stops written with all strings sustained, potentially impossible double-stops, difficult passages of fast multiple-stops
  * **Harp-specific issues**: double flats/sharps, impossible chords, too many notes in a chord, too many quick pedal changes
  * **Instrument-specific issues**: redundant mute indications, piano stretches too wide, flute harmonics incorrectly notated, fluttertongue incorrectly notated  * **Pitch**: incorrect use of clefs, clef change needed, incorrect use of 8va/8vb, 8va/8vb needed, horn written in bass clef unnecessarily
  * **Key signatures**: extreme key signatures (6 or more sharps/flats), rapid key signature change, redundant key signature change
  * **Time signatures**: missing first time signature, redundant time signatures
  * **Clefs**: instrument doesnâ€™t read given clef, redundant clef, clef change would improve readability
  * **Slurs**: slurs incorrectly begin/end on tied note, repeated notes under a slur without articulation, slur used instead of tie, accented notes in middle of a slur, slurs over rests, slurs within slurs, slurs attached to the same note
  * **Omissions**: rehearsal marks (for longer conducted works), initial tempo marking, pedal indications on pedal instrument
  * **Other**: fermatas inconsistent or missing across parts, tremolos incorrectly written, incorrect notation of grace notes, stems incorrectly flipped, note tied to different pitch, pickup bars with inconsistent rests, transposing score not switched on, unnecessarily complex key signatures, short key signature changes, redundant time signature changes, staccato on dotted notes, ties across rests***

### <img width="200px" src="MNCheckAccidentals.png" alt="Check Accidentals" style="vertical-align:top; margin-right:10px"> MN CHECK ACCIDENTALS

* **MN Check Accidentals** checks for: 
  * **augmented and diminished intervals** preceded or followed by another augmented or diminished interval (often a sign that an accidental has been misspelled)
  * **double-sharps & double-flats** which may not be necessary
  * **extreme accidentals** (e.g. B# Cb E# Fb), accounting for key signature
  * **recommended courtesy accidentals**
  * **preferred chromatic ascent/descent spelling**


## <a id="installation"></a>Installation

*MN Better Notation Plugins require MuseScore Studio 4.4 or later.*
* **Download** the project as a zip file either from the green Code button above, or from the direct download link below.
* **Extract it** using archive extraction software
* **Move the entire folder** into MuseScoreâ€™s plugins folder, configurable atÂ [Preferencesâ†’Generalâ†’Folders](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/4/preferences). The default directories are:
    * **Mac OS**: ~/Documents/MuseScore4/Plugins/
    * **Windows**: C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents\MuseScore4\Plugins\
    * **Linux**: ~/Documents/MuseScore4/Plugins
* **Open MuseScore** or quit and relaunch it if it was already open
* ClickÂ **Homeâ†’Plugins**Â orÂ **Pluginsâ†’Manage plugins...**
* For each of the four MN plugins, click on their icon and click â€˜**Enable**â€™
* The plugins should now be available from the **Plugins** menu

### Direct Download

Direct downloads of the Zip file can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/mnorrisvuw/MN-Better-Notation-Plugins-for-MuseScore/releases).

## <a id="use"></a>How to use
* Select the passage you wish to check for errors, or, to check the whole score, either select all or have nothing selected. Then  select the name of the plugin you wish to run from the Plugins menu. *(If you canâ€™t see the names of the plugins, check that you have enabled them â€” see installation instructions above)*

* Note that the *Check Layout and Instrumentation* plugin **always** checks the entire score, regardless of the current selection.

* The plugin will go through the selection/score looking for relevant issues. When it finds one, it will add a **yellow text box comment** on the score (somewhere close to the error), and will highlight the relevant notation object in pink. Once it has finished, it will present a dialog box telling you how many errors it found.

* **Note that the plugins do not fix the error themselves: that is up to you.**

* Sometimes these comments might be more of a suggestion rather than a hard-and-fast typesetting rule: you should therefore consider each comment carefully before remedying.

* It can be a good idea to delete each comment box as you fix the relevant issue to keep track of what you have done.

* If there are a lot of comments, sometimes a comment box can end up some distance away from the object it is referring to. If you canâ€™t work out what a comment is referring to, click and drag the box around a bit: you will see an â€˜attachment lineâ€™ that shows the location of the object to which it is referring.

* Each time you run a plugin, it will remove any previous comments or highlights.

* To manually remove all comments and highlights from a score, please run the â€˜MN Delete Comments and Highlightsâ€™ plugin

* Some comments refer to a specific page in [*Behind Bars* by Elaine Gould](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/0571514561). This is simply to provide a level of evidence behind some of my comments, in case you think them overly pedantic or plain wrong! ðŸ˜„


## Warning about usage
* Note that these plugins use the styles of their comment boxes (yellow fill, black border) to distinguish them from normal text objects and highlights.

* As such, if you select â€˜Formatâ†’Reset Text Style Overridesâ€™ or â€˜Formatâ†’Reset Entire Score to Default Layoutâ€™ while you still have comments on the score, MuseScore will revert them all to standard black-and-white text

* If this happens, the â€˜MN Delete Comments and Highlightsâ€™ will not be able to detect them to delete them, and you will have to go through and manually delete each one.

* Therefore, it is recommended that you do not use these commands while there are still comments on your score.

## Wait! Nothing happened!!!

* All of the plugins except â€˜MN Delete Comments and Highlightsâ€™ show a dialog box titled â€˜COMPLETIONâ€™ when they successfully complete their check of the score.

* However, if there is a bug in the plugin code that means it fails to successfully complete its checks, MuseScore does not currently have a way of letting the user know â€” instead it just does nothing and the dialog box does not show.

* **Therefore, if you do not get a â€˜COMPLETIONâ€™ dialog box after running the plugin, it may mean that MuseScore encountered a bug and could not complete the code. If that happens...**

## <a id="feedback"></a>Feedback, requests and bug reports

* Please send all feedback, feature requests and bug reports to michael.norris@vuw.ac.nz

* For bug reports, especially the â€˜non-completion bugsâ€™ mentioned above (i.e. the final dialog box does not show), **please send me your MuseScore file and the name of the plug-in.**

## <a id="knownbugs"></a>Known bugs and limitations

**MN Check Layout & Instrumentation**

* For some checks such as dynamics under rests, the plugin will not check if the instrument is on a grand staff (future versions should be able to do this, it just requires a bit more code)
* Redundant dynamics check doesnâ€™t yet check for *piÃ¹* or *meno*

**MN Check Rhythmic Notation**

* Ignores beaming of some time signatures that could be grouped in different ways
* Does not check for correct breaking of the 16th or 32nd beams

**MN Check Accidentals**

* Is not very intelligent about some of the extreme accidentals
